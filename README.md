# DSCI-551-Project
## In this file find the implementation for a natural language query database.
## When run with csv data files found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games/ the python file can take any natural language query about basketball players/teams from 2011-2018 and extract approrpiate information.
## The Code uses Generative AI technology that has been bolstered with dynamic 3 shot learnign using RAG
## The implementation uses spark to handle data distribution and my own joining and querying methods using sort merge join algorithims as well as map reduce operations for educational purposes
